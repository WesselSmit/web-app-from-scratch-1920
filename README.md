# Game - Movie adaption
<!-- Add a nice poster image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend ðŸ“¸ -->

This is a webapp to see if a game has a movie adaption. Search for a game and view which movies are adapted from it. Check its detail page for more info about the game and it adaptions. 

The app is a work in progress, but you can check it here: https://isirthijs.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-1920/
